## 🔧 Integration Strategy

### Option 1: Merge Extensions (Recommended)

**Combine both extensions into one unified tool**

**Pros:**

- Single extension to manage
- Seamless workflow
- Better user experience
- All features in one place

**Cons:**

- More complex codebase
- Larger extension size
- More testing needed

**Workflow:**

```
1. User opens YouTube Watch Later playlist
2. Multi-select videos (using existing extension features)
3. Click "Process with AI Studio" button
4. Videos automatically:
   - Move to "AI Processing" playlist
   - Add to automation queue
   - Process through AI Studio
   - Download reports
   - Mark as complete
```

---

### Option 2: Extension Communication (Simpler)

**Keep extensions separate but let them communicate**

**Pros:**

- Simpler to implement
- Less code changes
- Modular design
- Can use existing extension as-is

**Cons:**

- Two extensions to manage
- More complex user workflow
- Potential sync issues

**Workflow:**

```
1. Use Multiselect extension to select videos
2. Export selection to file
3. Import file into AI Studio Automator
4. Process videos
5. Manually move videos in YouTube
```

---

### Option 3: YouTube API Integration (Most Powerful)

**Add YouTube API directly to AI Studio Automator**

**Pros:**

- Full control over playlists
- Automated playlist management
- No dependency on other extensions
- Can create custom workflows

**Cons:**

- Requires YouTube API key
- OAuth authentication needed
- API quota limits
- More complex implementation

**Workflow:**

```
1. Authenticate with YouTube
2. Fetch Watch Later playlist
3. Display videos in extension UI
4. Select videos to process
5. Auto-move to custom playlist
6. Process through AI Studio
7. Update playlist status
```

## 💡 Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Quick Integration (1-2 hours)

**Add YouTube playlist export/import to current extension**

1. **Add "Import from YouTube Playlist" button**

   - User exports playlist using Multiselect extension
   - Paste JSON/HTML into our extension
   - Auto-parse and load into queue

2. **Add playlist metadata tracking**

   - Store original playlist ID
   - Track video position
   - Remember which playlist to move to

3. **Add post-processing actions**
   - Option to move videos after processing
   - Manual or automated

**Files to modify:**

- `popup.html` - Add import button
- `popup.js` - Add import parser
- `contentScript.js` - Add playlist tracking

---

### Phase 2: YouTube API Integration (4-6 hours)

**Full YouTube playlist management**

1. **Add YouTube API permissions**

   ```json
   "permissions": [
     "storage",
     "activeTab",
     "scripting",
     "identity"  // For OAuth
   ],
   "oauth2": {
     "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
     "scopes": [
       "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube",
       "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl"
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Create YouTube API service**

   ```javascript
   // youtube-api.js
   -authenticateUser() -
     getPlaylists() -
     getPlaylistVideos(playlistId) -
     moveVideoToPlaylist(videoId, fromPlaylist, toPlaylist) -
     removeFromPlaylist(videoId, playlistId);
   ```

3. **Add playlist UI**

   - Dropdown to select source playlist
   - Dropdown to select destination playlist
   - "Fetch Videos" button
   - Video selection checkboxes

4. **Automated workflow**
   - Fetch from Watch Later
   - Process through AI Studio
   - Move to "AI Processed" playlist
   - Update status

---

### Phase 3: Full Merge (8-12 hours)

**Integrate Multiselect features directly**

1. **Add content script for YouTube pages**

   - Inject multi-select UI
   - Add selection controls
   - Add "Process with AI" button

2. **Merge UI components**

   - Action bar from Multiselect
   - Queue management from AI Studio Automator
   - Unified control panel

3. **Add advanced features**
   - Filter videos before processing
   - Find duplicates before processing
   - Batch operations
