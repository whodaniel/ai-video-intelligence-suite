## 🏗️ ACROSS THE TWO PROJECTS

### 1. Gemini Browser Skill (CLI Tool) - _ACTIVE WORKHORSE_

**Location:** `Desktop/A1-Inter-LLM-Com/The-New-Fuse/packages/gemini-browser-skill`

**Role:** Personal Automation Engine for your 633-video library.

**Recent Achievements:**

- ✅ **Robust Chrome Automation**: Implemented `launch-chrome.sh` to auto-handle debugging ports.
- ✅ **Playwright Integration**: More stable than Puppeteer for long sessions.
- ✅ **Gap Analysis Engine**: Logic to detect "Visual Gaps" in transcripts is LIVE here.
- ✅ **Transcript Fallback**: Uses `yt-dlp` if UI scraping fails.

**Use Case:**

- "I want to process my 633 videos RIGHT NOW." => **Use this.**

### 2. AI Studio Automator (Chrome Extension) - _COMMERCIAL PRODUCT_

**Location:** `Projects/ai-studio-automator`

**Role:** User-friendly product for the Chrome Web Store.

**Recent Achievements:**

- ✅ **UI/UX**: Beautiful popup, playlist management, OAuth.
- ✅ **Infrastructure**: Solid message passing, storage, service workers.
- ✅ **Cost Optimization**: Strategy defined.

**Pending Integration:**

- ⏳ **Porting Gap Analysis**: The "Visual Gap" logic from the CLI tool needs to be moved here.

## 🔄 SYNCHRONIZATION PLAN

1. **Prove Logic in CLI**: We are currently finalizing the "Gap Analysis" and "Multimodal Fill" logic in the CLI tool.
2. **Port to Extension**: Once proven on your 633 videos, we copy the prompt logic and control flow to `contentScript.js` in the extension.
3. **Release**: The extension launches with "Enterprise-Grade" gap detection features born from your personal use case.
