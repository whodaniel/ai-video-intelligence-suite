**Date:** January 18, 2026
**Status:** Phoenix Edition - All Blocking Errors Fixed

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied from CLI Tool Learnings

### 1. Model Update
- **Updated to:** `gemini-3-flash-preview` (latest as of Jan 2026)
- **Previously:** Generic/older model references
- **Benefit:** Eliminates "model not found" errors

### 2. Error Detection & Recovery
- ✅ Added comprehensive error detection for:
  - **Permission Denied** - Detects when AI Studio session needs manual verification
  - **Unknown Error** - Identifies automation detection
  - **Rate Limiting** - Handles quota exceeded errors
  - **Generation Failed** - Catches failed generations

- ✅ Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff:
  - Max 3 retries per operation
  - 2-second base delay, increasing per attempt
  - Critical errors (Permission Denied) skip retry and alert user

### 3. Model Selection
- ✅ Added `ensureCorrectModel()` function
- Automatically verifies and switches to `gemini-3-flash-preview`
- Prevents using outdated/unavailable models

### 4. Real-time Error Monitoring
- Errors checked every 5 seconds during processing
- Immediate detection and reporting of issues
- Prevents wasted processing time on failed operations

### 5. Enhanced Logging
- All log messages include "Phoenix" identifier
- Clear indication of which model is being used
- Better debugging information for troubleshooting
